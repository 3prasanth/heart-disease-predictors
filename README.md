# heart-disease-predictors
# Heart-Disease-
Importing the libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

And then import and Read file

check the file sucessfully imported or not
using this code "df.head()"

check the null values in the date set

check the dateset have outliers or not

we use iqr for removing outliers of bp and cholestrol

encoding is not required in this dataset 

spliting the data int 80 and 20

 Model Trianig - X_train,y_train - fit funtion
 Model testing - x_test- gives y_pred - predict funtion
 Model evalution - y_test,y_pred - confusion_matrix, accuracy_score,recall,precision,f1_score

 import logisticregression

 check the accuracy score of logisticregression
 
import Kneigbhorsclassifier

check the accuracy score of kneighbrsclassifier

i go for logisticregression is closest to the 1

And finally import the gradio 
#heart-disease-predictors
